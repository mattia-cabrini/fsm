A Finite State Machine library

* Why
One could argue that there are a lot of finite state machine libraries out there and that it would be of no utility to create yet onother one. You'd be right; Nonetheless I wanted to do it anyway.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.[1] An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two typesâ€”deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines.[2] A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one."

I'm not going to furnish you a guide on how to design your FSM. If you are here, you're supposed to already be knowing it.

** Example of FSM and what the library allows you to do
To present the main features of this library, let's take a look at the following example:
